 * Purpose: Declaration of Graph class
 *          This class represents an undirected Graph (no weight on each edge)
 *          using adjacent map representation
 *          It contains one private data memeber: adjMap
 *          which represents the mapping from a Vertex, say u (key) to a set of vertices (value) which directly connect to u
